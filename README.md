## A Knowledge-demonstration of some dude

I'm currently working on TOP. I'm looking to enhance my webdev-skills and I am pursuing further training. Though I have made websites before, some of them have been terrible and some of them have been overkill. I want to engage in the artistry of programming in the accessible medium of webdev.

## Recipes galore

This is a set of a few family recipes that I have, as well as a few ones that I've made over the years without any familal relations.
