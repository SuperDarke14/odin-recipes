                <h1>Rice Wine</h1>
		<h2>Rice wine from Korea-- Makgeolli</h2>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p>Makgeolli is a type of rice wine. It is made from rice and a special fermentation agent called nuruk. Nuruk is fermented wheat that has a particular mixture of enzymes and natural yeasts in it. The enzymes in the nuruk digest the starches in the rice (normally inaccessible to the yeast) into simple sugars. The yeast, then, performs mankind's favorite reaction: turning sugars into alcohol.</p>
		<p>Makgeolli usually comes in at around 10% ABV or 20 proof. This means it's stronger than beer but weaker than most (grape) wines. Makgeolli is slightly fizzy and sweet. It has a propensity to separate into two layers in storage. The top layer is clear and very smooth. The bottom layer is cloudy and has a more robust flavor.</p>
		<p>Makgeolli is an essential component in producing the most-consumed drink in the world: soju. Soju is merely distilled Makgeolli (which means it's stronger [20%ABV/40 proof]). Makgeolli has been consumed for about 2000 years in Korea. It is incredibly simple to make and yields incredible resutls</p>

		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<h6>This recipe scales very well, so each ingredient is a proportion rather than a specific quantity</h6>
		<ul> 
			<li>10 parts white rice</li>
			<li>Equal amount of water by weight</li>
			<li>1 part nuruk (can be bought online or, perhaps, at a Korean/Asian grocery store)</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Nonstandard equipment needed</h4>
                <ul>
                        <li>Large vessel (sterilized, preferably)</li>
                </ul>
		
		<h2>Directions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Wash the rice <em>very thoroughly</em>. It should rinse clear from the bowl.</li>
			<li>Cook the rice as you normally would cook rice</li>
			<li>Spread cooked rice out as soon as possible on a clean (preferably sterilized) surface.</li>
			<li>As rice is cooling, mix nuruk and an equal amount of water together.</li>
			<li>Once rice is cooled to less than 100 degrees Farenheit, mix together nuruk, remaining water, and rice in fermenting vessel.</li>
			<li>Allow to ferment for at least 10 days, stirring occasionally at the start.</li>
			<li>Strain any remnants and enjoy responsibly.</li>
		</ol>
		<h4>Produces around 80-90% of original volume of ingredients</h4>
		<h4>Prep time: 2-3 hours</h4>
		<h4>Fermentation time: 10-21 days</h4>
		<p>Nota bene: Make sure that your fermentation vessel has a 1-way valve on it or you burp it every day or two lest it build up pressure and explode. That would be a tragedy.</p>
