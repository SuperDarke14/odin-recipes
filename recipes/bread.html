			<li>3 cups of flour, plus a bit more for surfaces</li>
			<li>1 1/2 cups of water</li>

			<li>2 tsp. salt</li>
			<li>Cornmeal (optional, but recommended)</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Directions</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Mix yeast, salt, flour and water until just mixed. It should be a bit shaggier than normal bread dough</li>

			<li>Turn dough out of bowl and fold it over itself horizontally and vertically</li>
			<li>Sprinkle cornmeal over the dough</li>
